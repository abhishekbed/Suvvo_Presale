# Token Presale Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity-based smart contract that implements a token presale mechanism for ERC20 token launches. The contract allows users to participate in a presale by contributing funds in exchange for tokens at a predefined rate, with built-in limits and sale controls.

---

## 📌 Overview

The presale contract manages:

- Accepting participant contributions
- Enforcing presale parameters such as caps and duration
- Tracking user allocations
- Allowing users to claim tokens after the presale ends

All logic is executed on-chain to ensure transparency and trustless execution.
